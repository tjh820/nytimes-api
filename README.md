Moodvie App
A fun app that allows you to upload a photo. That photo gets analyzed for an emotion and a moview is recommended based on that emotion.


With the increase of "Netflix" and chill and spending hours trying to deside what to watch, this fun little app will help with that, we will select a movie for you.
